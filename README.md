# Pinboard

## Background
Pinboard is a [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) clone built on react and rails.

See Pinboard live [here](https://pin-board-8f19ce7d10cc.herokuapp.com/)

## Features
In Pinboard, users are able to:
- Sign up for an account; current users can login and log out
    - Non users can login as Demo User 1 (testuser7) or Demo User 2 (green_yogi) to view the site. These two profiles provide two different ways to look at how someone might use the site (for ex. Demo User 1 has more food/recipe focused boards, while Demo User 2 has a home design board).
- Create, edit, and delete Pins
    - Pins are virtual "pins" - users will upload pictures for each pin, which is a virtual visual bookmark for an idea, that can be linked to a webpage such as a blog post or article.
- Create, edit, and delete Boards that contain Pins
    - In order to organize pins, users can create virtual "boards" to save pins to. Users are able to save a pin to a different board than the board a pin is currently saved in.
